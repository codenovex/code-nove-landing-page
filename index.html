<section class="section fade-in" id="investment-rationale">
    <h3>💡 THE SMARTEST INVESTMENT YOU’LL EVER MAKE</h3>
    <p>This is not a course. It is not an eBook. It is a one-time upgrade to the most valuable asset you will ever own: <strong>your mind.</strong></p>
    <p>High-performers don't hesitate to invest in the best tools—the fastest computers, the most ergonomic chairs, the sharpest software. Yet, they often neglect the operating system that runs everything: their own cognitive engine.</p>
    
    <h4>Why the Premium Investment?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>This is a permanent asset, not a temporary subscription.</strong> Unlike apps that charge you monthly for surface-level features, CODE NOVE is a one-time installation that delivers compounding value for a lifetime.</li>
        <li><strong>It is the result of years of deep work.</strong> This system was not written in a week. It is the refined output of hundreds of iterations, personal experimentation, and system architecture designed to create real change, not just provide fleeting motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>The price is a filter.</strong> A premium investment ensures that the system is acquired by individuals who are serious about implementation. It attracts doers, not just dabblers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The real cost isn’t $499 — it’s another year wasted on distraction, burnout, and scattered focus.</p>
    <p>CODE NOVE is the most leveraged investment you can make in your future—a direct upgrade to the engine that powers every single result you will ever produce.</p>

    <h3>💡 WHY $199 / ₹2,499 IS A STEAL</h3>
    <p>Most people spend hundreds of dollars every year on books, courses, and subscriptions they never finish.</p>
    <p><strong>$199 is less than the cost of replacing your phone screen.</strong><br>
    <strong>₹2,499 is less than one night out at a mid-range restaurant in India.</strong></p>
    <p>But Code Nove isn’t another piece of content you’ll forget.<br>
    It’s a one-time neural operating system upgrade:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>🔐 <strong>Lifetime access</strong> — no subscriptions, no hidden charges</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Encrypted offline system</strong> — works forever, even without internet</li>
        <li>🚀 <strong>Permanent results</strong> — not “motivation,” but actual rewiring of your brain</li>

    <p>When you install Code Nove, you’re not paying for information.<br>
    <strong>You’re investing in the engine that powers everything in your life: your mind.</strong></p>

    <p>The real cost isn’t $199 or ₹2,499.<br>
    It’s another year wasted on distraction, procrastination, and scattered focus.</p>

    <p class="highlight">⚡ Founder’s Access is limited. Today, it’s $199 / ₹2,499. Next phase, the price will rise — forever.</p>
